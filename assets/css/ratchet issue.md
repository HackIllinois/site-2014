#Bug in the demo for 'Table view with Toggles' on mobile


When I first read @twbootsrap's tweet about Ratchet, I pulled up the Ratchet component demo page within the twitter app. All was fine until I reached the Table view+Toggles demo and started playing around with the toggles a little bit.

The visual bug I came across is hard to describe - You'll get a better idea of what it is when you try and replicate it (steps given below)

OS: iOS7
Browsers: Chrome, Safari, the browsers built into the Twitter and Facebook apps

How to replicate:
(I'm following all steps up with a screenshot of what the UI state is after the above/corresponding step)

1. Pull up the Ratchet components page on a mobile device, and navigate to the toggles demo make sure you're viewing the demo for the 'base' theme.
