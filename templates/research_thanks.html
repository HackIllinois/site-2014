                    Thanks for you participation in the HackIllinois survey!

                    You response will help us make a better HackIllinois experience and to
                    better understand the way that groups form and
                    work together at hackathons.

                    If you complete <strong>both portions of the survey</strong>, you will be entered into
                    a lottery for a $100 Amazon gift card. If you win,
                    an email will be sent to the email associated with
                    your HackIllinois application.
